DESCRIPTION
-----------

Beginnings of a barebones application or operating system using the
Beagle Board (OMAP3) or Panda Board (OMAP4).

COMPILATION
-----------

To generate a U-boot image (.uimg) file:

    make

To assemble a NAND flash image and test it with QEMU/Meego:

    make test

There are also 'clean' and 'distclean' targets available.

TESTING
-------

Besides the 'make test' target above, take a look at the 'boot.sh'
script. It can be used to load the U-boot image over the serial port
onto a Beagle Board.

For example:

- Plug in and power on a Beagle Board with a serial cable to /dev/ttyS0
- Run 'make && sh boot.sh'
- Expected output:

Alternative direct USB boot for Panda Board:

- Build kernel using 'make'
- Hook up Panda Board to USB port using its OTG port
- Open Minicom in another window
- Run: ./usbboot direct-aboot.bin terrier.bin

Alternative alternative USB+serial boot:

- Open Minicom in another Window
- Run: ./usbboot u-boot/OMAP4460/u-boot.bin
- Bring up U-boot prompt in Minicom
- Quit Minicom without Reset (C-a q)
- Run: sh boot.sh

NOTES
-----

By default, the Makefile uses the CodeSourcery arm-none-linux-gnueabi
(GNU/Linux) tool-chain. You can also use arm-none-eabi if you want.

The GNU/Linux TAR contains the necessary files. Just unpack it and put
the 'bin' directory in your path. There are also projects out there,
such as EmDebian, with these tools packaged for your distribution.

usbboot and direct-aboot.bin are compiled from omap4boot:
